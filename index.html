                <h3>Wednesday, November 25th is a big day for fans of scientific breakthroughs that re-shape our understanding of
                    how
                    the universe operates. One hundred years ago, Albert Einstein discovered the general theory of relativity.</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>SPEECH</li>
                    <p>Einstein was supposedly slow to talk—the man himself told his biographer he didn’t start speaking until at
                        least age
                        three. Stanford economist Dr. Thomas Sowell even coined the controversial term “Einstein Syndrome” to
                        describe
                        exceptionally bright people whose speech is delayed.</p>
                    <li>THE COMPAS</li>
                    <p>When Albert Einstein was five years old his father showed him a simple pocket compass. Einstein was
                        mesmerized. What
                        force exerted itself on the little needle to make it point in a single direction? This question stayed with
                        Einstein for many years and has been noted as the beginning of his fascination with science.</p>
                    <li>THE VIOLIN</li>
                    <p>Einstein’s mother, Pauline, was an accomplished pianist and wanted her son to love music too, so she started
                        him on
                        violin lessons. At first, Einstein hated playing the violin. When Einstein was 13-years old, he quickly
                        changed his
                        mind about the violin when he heard the music of Mozart. With a new passion for playing, Einstein continued
                        to play
                        the violin until the last few years of his life.</p>
                    <li>PRESIDENT EINSTEIN?</li>
                    <p>A few days after Zionist leader and first President of Israel Chaim Weizmann died on November 9, 1952,
                        Einstein was
                        asked if he would accept the position of being the second president of Israel. Einstein, age 73, declined
                        the
                        offer. In his official letter of refusal, Einstein stated that he lacked the “natural aptitude and the
                        experience
                        to deal properly with people.”</p>
                    <li>CAPTAIN EINSTEIN</li>
                    <p>Einstein loved sailing, even though he wasn’t very good at it—his neighbors on Long Island frequently had to
                        help
                        him right his capsized boat Tinef (Yiddish for “worthless”). And even though Einstein never learned to
                        swim, he
                        kept sailing as a hobby throughout his life.</p>
                    <li>NO SOCKS</li>
                    <p>Part of Einstein’s charm was his disheveled look. In addition to his uncombed hair, one of Einstein’s
                        peculiar
                        habits was to never wear socks. To Einstein, socks were a pain because they often would get holes in them.</p>
